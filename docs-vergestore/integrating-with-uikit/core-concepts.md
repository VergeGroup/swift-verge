# ViewModel



{% hint style="warning" %}
Sorry, this documentation is currently working in progress.

We have a sub-framework VergeViewModel.  
This helps UIKit based application.

VergeStore is a state container and that state will be bigger according to the application scale.  
 You would need something that map to view-state.

In SwiftUI, `SwiftUI.View` is that. But UIKit is not.

It may be a better way to get ViewModel or something.
